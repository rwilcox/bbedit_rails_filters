Filters
============================

Filters do the following functions:

 * `rails_emacs_mode`: adds an emacs modeline to enforce Rails whitespace conventions. It also will set the alternative file for BBEdit to an appropriate file (files in app/ are mapped to their appropriate files in spec/ or test/, and same the other way). Use File -> Open Counterpart for Rails projects!!!
